Hello!
I'm a Full-Stack developer from Germany. I started programming when I was pretty young and have gathered a lot of experience since then. I'm always open for new ideas, so feel free to contact me!

My main project right now is my API-agnostic rendering engine: "Arch". although I also work on other project every now and then.
I have mostly been doing projects by myself until now, but i hope that this will change in the near future.

I go to the gym regularly when I'm not working on projects, or am otherwise occupied.

Fun fact: I taught myself JavaScript in about 30 minutes after watching [Fireship](youtube.com/@fireship)'s [100 seconds of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOChLn5ZdQ) video. But thats only because JS is so similar to C, and I'm already a good C dev.

I don't know what to say here anymore. If you have questions, advice, etc: message me.
